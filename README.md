# Terrorism-dashboard(PowerBI)
# Task-2 Interncareer
# Excited to share my latest project using Power BI as a part of my internship as Data Analyst Intern at InternCareer, where I delved into the intriguing realm of global terrorism data! 
# Utilizing comprehensive dataset, I crafted insightful visualizations shedding light on various aspects of terrorist activities worldwide. 
# Here's a glimpse into what I've accomplished:

  Pie and Donut charts: Analyzed success rates by type of attack, target type, and type of weapon, offering a clear understanding of patterns and trends.

 Clustered bar chart: Mapped success rates by region, enabling nuanced comparisons and regional insights.

 Line chart: Explored the total attack over the period  in the global terrorism landscape.

 Area chart: Tracked the count of incidents over the years, providing a historical perspective on terrorism occurrences.

 Map: Visualized the geographical distribution of terrorist activities, offering a spatial understanding of hotspots and trends.
   
 Waterfall Chart:Show the cumulative effect of targeted individual in terrorism occurence.

Decomposition Tree: Break down a measure into its contributing factors like the total attacks including their types and subtypes.

Page Navigator:  used to simplify navigation across the country page in report.

Bookmarks: used to capture the state of a report and allow users to easily return to that state or to navigate between different view like terrorist group, weapon types and attack types.

 Leveraging slicers for country and year of attack, types of attack , types of terrorsit group and types of weapon  I empowered users to dynamically interact with the data, enhancing their exploration and analysis experience.
